<h3> The Millenial School Overview</h3>

  The Millenial School, established in 2001 in Karachi, is now a chain of schools with 4 campuses in Karachi. This is our 18th year of Academic Excellence. We are affiliated with University of Cambridge, London and Board of Secondary Education too.  Millenial School is also running its own Academy of Montessori Teachers' Training, under the shadow of International Montessori Counsel, USA. Most of our students opt to take the Matriculation or international GCE O and AS/A Level examinations. We have approximately 1000+ students studying in Our School. Also, more than 500 families are registered on our social networking pages and website. The Millenial School (abbreviated as TMS) is one of the largest private English medium school systems in Pakistan established in 2001. It offers primary education, secondary education and preparation for local SSC and the international GCE. TMS has earned its outstanding reputation through its students' successes, its rigorous educational programs and its excellent and dedicated staff.

<h3>Curriculum & Academic Philosophy</h3>
<p>
  Graduates from The Millenial School secure positions in top universities worldwide. Our studentsare amongst the highest achievers in their city, their country and, in some cases, in the world. The curriculum encourages a student-centered approach where learners have an active role in their learning process and develop the skills and ability to make a significant contribution to society. Its particular strength lies in the integration of digital media and ICTs in an array of learning programmes. The Millenial School provides more than 10 courses each year across the age ranges and revises them in accordance with the cumulative experience of its teachers and pupils. The selection of teachers is based on their experience as curriculum developers and syllabus writers. In addition, we regularly appoint curriculum consultants from the UK to lead teams of The Millenial School teachers in revising their curriculum and syllabi. The Millenial School curriculum and methodology is designed specifically to ensure a smooth transition in teaching and learning from the primary sector through the middle years and on to the final two years of the public examinations' syllabi. Digital media and ICTs in The Millenial School Network are shaping the methodology of delivering online education and adding efficiency, convenience, interactivity and outreach to the array of learning programmes we offer. The Millenial School has taken the initiative of implementing a state-of-the-art Classroom/ Learning Management System capable of providing its students with academic resources anytime, anywhere, and in any circumstances. The Millenial School promotes and encourages co-curricular activities in all of its campuses. Students are encouraged to learn new skills, take responsibility, assume leadership, work under a leader, organise events, conduct programmes and experience real-life situations.
